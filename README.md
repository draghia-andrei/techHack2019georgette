## Our idea (3-4 sentences)
Securely link customer financial profiles with businesses, to enable easier identification of "good customers".

Built of 2 aspects:
 1. Regular persons
   - helps you decide if you money allows you to buy that new Graphics Card this month and what you compromise for it
   - asking importance feedback per each transaction to identifying spending habbits

 2. Businesses
   - Admin - defines rules of what means a "good customer" for you
   - Employee - type CNP and receives a SCORE telling him how "valuable" he is for your business.
       - Employee knows to focus on him
       - Admin knows how to adjust the profile of "good customer" if needed, gets reports and can better plan
